Just Do It
The project built on React uses the following dependencies: 
React-router-dom, react-helmet, Formik, react-redux, reduxjs/toolkit. 
Used Firebase for authorization and database. Validation is provided 
during authorization. After authorization, you get to your own account 
with your own tasks, which you can add, delete and edit. All changes are 
saved. Also used BEM methodology.
